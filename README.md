> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

- [Designing better target sizes](https://ishadeed.com/article/target-size/)
- [Techniques to Break Words](https://adrianroselli.com/2024/02/techniques-to-break-words.html)
  - Probably don’t add `&shy;` without guidance from a copywriter.
  - Probably don’t add `&shy;` to foreign words without a localization expert or at least a native speaker.
  - Probably don’t add `&shy;` to URLs, email addresses, code blocks, and so on.
  - Probably restrict `<wbr>` to URLs, email addresses, code blocks, and similar words where technical accuracy is paramount.
  - Probably restrict `<wbr>` to _before_ periods and dashes and maybe slashes in URLs and emails so it doesn’t look like the sentence or address has ended.
- [Getting Started with Style Queries](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/style-queries?hl=en)
