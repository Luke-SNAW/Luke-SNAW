> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

## Week 29, 2023

- Software Engineering at Google - ch.1~6
- [How React 18 Improves Application Performance](https://vercel.com/blog/how-react-18-improves-application-performance)
- [[Browser] 리소스 우선순위 - preload, preconnect, prefetch](https://beomy.github.io/tech/browser/preload-preconnect-prefetch/)
  > `prefetch`를 사용하면 리소스를 미리 캐시 해 두기 때문에 성능이 향상될 것이라고 예상. 하지만 vue-cli3에서 제공하는 prefetch 기능을 사용하면 오히려 첫 렌더링 성능이 저하되는 것으로 확인

## Week 28, 2023

- [JavaScript closest](https://davidwalsh.name/element-closest)

  const link = document.querySelector("li a")
  const list = a.closest("ul")
  ```
