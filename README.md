- [Avoid 2:00 and 3:00 am cron jobs!](https://www.endpointdev.com/blog/2013/04/avoid-200-and-300-am-cron-jobs/) Most of the time such cron jobs will run fine, but if they run every Sunday morning, then twice per year they will run at the exact time daylight savings time (aka summer time) kicks in or ends, sometimes with very strange results.
  > Just use UTC folks unless you have a really good idea why you shouldn't. - [noir_lord](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45723859)
  > I put a little analog clock on my desk that's set to UTC time. It helps a lot with converting logs to get a quick reference. - [yabones](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45724173)
- [It's insulting to read your AI-generated blog post](https://blog.pabloecortez.com/its-insulting-to-read-your-ai-generated-blog-post/)

  - Making mistakes and learning from them is a fundamentally human experience.
  - AI-generated content creates a sterile barrier between the writer and the reader.
  - This barrier prevents genuine engagement and connection.

  > I personally don’t think I care if a blog post is AI generated or not. The only thing that matters to me is the content. I use ChatGPT to learn about a variety of different things, so if someone came up with an interesting set of prompts and follow ups and shared a summary of the research ChatGPT did, it could be meaningful content to me.
  >
  > > No, don't use it to fix your grammar, or for translations, or for whatever else you think you are incapable of doing. Make the mistake. Feel embarrassed. Learn from it. Why? Because that's what makes us human!
  >
  > It would be more human to handwrite your blog post instead. I don’t see how this is a good argument. The use of tools to help with writing and communication should make it easier to convey your thoughts, and that itself is valuable. - [alyxya](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45723176)

- [Cloudflare’s 2025 Annual Founders’ Letter](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-2025-annual-founders-letter/)
  - The internet's core business model has historically relied on traffic generation (ads, subscriptions) to reward content creators.
  - Traffic has been an imperfect proxy for value, leading to issues like clickbait and ragebait, driven by the need to maximize traffic.
  - The shift from Search Engines to Answer Engines (like AI chatbots) is fundamentally changing internet discovery, providing direct answers instead of links.
    - This transition is causing significant short-term pain for industries reliant on traffic monetization, particularly media companies.
  - A new internet business model is emerging, potentially rewarding creators of unique, original content that fills knowledge gaps identified by AI.

## Week 43, 2025

- [How Complex Systems Fail](https://how.complexsystems.fail)
  - Complex systems always contain latent failures that change over time due to technological and organizational changes.
  - Complex systems operate in a degraded mode, with continuous failures and repairs, making accidents seem inevitable in hindsight.
  - Post-accident analyses often incorrectly attribute failures to a single root cause, overlooking the multiple contributing factors.
  - Hindsight bias affects post-accident assessments, making it difficult to accurately evaluate human performance during the event.
- [Fallout from the AWS outage: Smart mattresses go rogue](https://quasa.io/media/the-strangest-fallout-from-the-aws-outage-smart-mattresses-go-rogue-and-ruin-sleep-worldwide) - An AWS outage caused widespread disruptions, including issues with smart mattresses from Eight Sleep.
- [How Deno protects against npm exploits](https://deno.com/blog/deno-protects-npm-exploits)
  - Deno offers a secure alternative by running code in a sandbox with no OS access by default.
  - Deno requires explicit permissions for file system access, network connections, and environment variables.
  - But, deno's current permission model is applied on a per-project basis, meaning if a project has already granted permissions, a malicious package could exploit those permissions. Fine-grained permission control per package (e.g., per-package permissions) is not yet fully implemented, which prevents complete blocking of supply chain attacks.

> I've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice? Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely. — [aliasxneo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41497113)

> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment. — [CE02](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35056071)
