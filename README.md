> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

## Week 01, 2024

- [LLMs and Programming in the first days of 2024](http://antirez.com/news/140)
  > The author discusses their extensive use of large language models for programming tasks over the past year. They find LLMs most helpful for writing disposable code, learning new frameworks quickly, and accelerating documentation searches. While useful, LLMs still struggle with system programming problems requiring complex reasoning. The author believes LLMs have begun to show rudimentary reasoning abilities through their interpolation of concepts, but their capabilities are still limited. Overall, they argue LLMs are a valuable tool for programmers that can help focus time on more important problems and skills.

## Week 52, 2023

- [Stop using {} in Typescript](https://medium.com/@sukheja.varun/stop-using-in-typescript-ed24d3532d9e)
  - `Record<string, unkown>`
  - `{ [key:string]: unknown }`
- [Introducing four new international features in CSS](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-i18n-features?hl=en)
  - From Chrome 119: Japanese phrase line breaking with `word-break: auto-phrase`.
  - Behind a flag from Chrome 120: Inter-script spacing with the `text-autospace` property.

- [Micro Frontend Synergy: Techniques for Effective Communication](https://medium.com/@rk-tech/micro-frontend-synergy-techniques-for-effective-communication-97df104931ed)
- [How Pinterest scaled to 11 million users with only 6 engineers](https://read.engineerscodex.com/p/how-pinterest-scaled-to-11-million)
  - Use known, proven technologies. Pinterest’s dive into newer technologies at the time led to issues like data corruption.
  - Keep it simple. (A recurring theme!)
  - Don’t get too creative. The team settled on an architecture where they could add more of the same nodes to scale.
  - Limit your options.
  - Sharding databases > clustering. It reduced data transfer across nodes, which was a good thing.
  - Have fun! New engineers would contribute code in their first week.
- [How Big is YouTube?](https://ethanzuckerman.com/2023/12/22/how-big-is-youtube/)
  > He details an experiment where he and others were able to collect over 10,000 truly random YouTube videos using an inefficient "drunk dialing" method to guess video URLs.
  > This allowed them to estimate that YouTube contains over 13 billion videos and that 4 billion were added just in 2023.
