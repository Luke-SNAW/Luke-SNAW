## Week 52, 2025

- [Send email with SMTP relay from a printer, scanner, or app](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en)
- ['It's a moment of death and rebirth': The ancient monuments saluting the winter solstice](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251219-the-ancient-monuments-saluting-the-winter-solstice)
  - Ancient monuments across the Northern Hemisphere, some dating back 5,000 years, are precisely aligned to capture the rising and setting sun during the winter solstice.
  - The winter solstice, occurring around December 21st or 22nd, marks the shortest day of the year and symbolizes the end of one cycle and the beginning of another, with days gradually lengthening afterward.
- [I got hacked, my server started mining Monero this morning.](https://blog.jakesaunders.dev/my-server-started-mining-monero-this-morning/)
  - The author's server was compromised and used to mine Monero for 10 days due to a vulnerability in the Umami analytics tool, which is built with Next.js.
  - The vulnerability (CVE-2025-66478) was an unsafe deserialization flaw in Next.js's React Server Components' Flight protocol, allowing arbitrary code execution.
  - Despite the compromise, container isolation prevented the malware from escaping the Umami container and affecting the host system or other containers.

## Week 51, 2025

- [LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM)
  - Effective writing, especially for experts, is not about adhering to rules but about focusing on the reader and their needs.
  - Experts often use their writing process to aid their complex thinking, a contrast to journalists who typically use writing to convey pre-formed ideas.
  - Academic writing should aim to change how readers see the world, rather than simply conveying the writer's own ideas or demonstrating understanding.
  - Effective academic writing involves understanding and using the 'code' of a specific community of readers to communicate value and persuade them.
  - Academic conversations are dynamic and evolving, with knowledge being constructed and deconstructed by communities, rather than being a static accumulation of facts.
- [30 Years of `<br>` Tags](https://www.artmann.co/articles/30-years-of-br-tags) - Three decades of making things on the internet
- [AI's real superpower: consuming, not creating](https://msanroman.io/blog/ai-consumption-paradigm)
  - AI's real superpower lies not in creation, but in consumption and analysis of vast amounts of existing information.
  - A personal knowledge management system, like an Obsidian vault, can store years of notes, reflections, and insights.
  - Connecting an AI to a personal knowledge base allows users to query their past discoveries and evolving thoughts.
- [Why Your Best Engineers Are Interviewing Elsewhere](https://codegood.co/writing/why-your-best-engineers-are-interviewing-elsewhere)
  - Hierarchies within organizations tend to filter out bad news, preventing executives from being aware of developing problems until they become crises.
  - Middle managers often suppress bad news to appear professional and 'handle problems at their level,' leading to information latency.
  - Skip-level conversations (executives talking directly to engineers several levels down) are often discouraged due to concerns about undermining middle management, but they provide crucial ground truth.
- [Software Component Names Should Be Whimsical And Cryptic](https://medium.com/better-programming/software-component-names-should-be-whimsical-and-cryptic-ca260b013de0)
  - Descriptive names for software components can be misleading as the scope and purpose of a component can change over time, rendering the original name inaccurate.
  - Descriptive names create an [illusion of transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency) rather than true clarity, leading to incorrect assumptions about a component's functionality.
  - For variables within code that are frequently changed, descriptive names like numCols and numRows are preferable to generic ones like i and j.
  - When a name serves as an identifier for a complex, long-lived entity, it should be an opaque and immutable identifier, similar to using numerical IDs instead of email addresses as foreign keys in databases.

> I've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice?
