> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

- [LLMs and Programming in the first days of 2024](http://antirez.com/news/140)
  > The author discusses their extensive use of large language models for programming tasks over the past year. They find LLMs most helpful for writing disposable code, learning new frameworks quickly, and accelerating documentation searches. While useful, LLMs still struggle with system programming problems requiring complex reasoning. The author believes LLMs have begun to show rudimentary reasoning abilities through their interpolation of concepts, but their capabilities are still limited. Overall, they argue LLMs are a valuable tool for programmers that can help focus time on more important problems and skills.
