- [How I Use Slack](https://gpeal.medium.com/how-i-use-slack-b0dbf06d9a18)
- [Static typing helps, but only a little.](https://buildtogether.tech/tooling/#:~:text=Static%20typing%20helps%2C%20but%20only%20a%20little.)
  - A [statically-typed](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#static_typing) language like Java requires programmers to specify the data type of each variable; a [dynamically-typed](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#dynamic_typing) one like Python doesn't require them, though you can add them if you want, while TypeScript adds types as a layer on top of JavaScript. \[[Endrikat2014](https://buildtogether.tech/bibliography/#Endrikat2014)\] found that declaring types does add complexity to programs, but it pays off fairly quickly by acting as documentation and by making [auto-completion](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#auto_completion) more accurate.
