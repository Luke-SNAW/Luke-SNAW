## Week 21, 2024

- [iTerm2 and AI hype overload](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2024/ai-hype/)

  - Airbnb has made improving web accessibility a priority, focusing on the WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text guideline. This guideline is important for users with low vision, as it requires web content to be maintained when text is scaled 200%.
- [New alternatives to innerHTML](https://fullystacked.net/innerhtml-alternatives/)
  - `setHTML`
  - `setHTMLUnsafe` does not perform input sanitization. The setHTMLUnsafe method is particularly useful for working with declarative shadow DOM, where the contents of a `<template>` element with the shadowrootmode attribute need to be rendered as shadow DOM. The setHTML method would remove the template element entirely, whereas setHTMLUnsafe preserves it.
