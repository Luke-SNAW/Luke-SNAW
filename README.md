  > Long story short, Promises are just objects with some additional functionality to change their internal state.
  >
  > The cool thing about Promises is that this can trigger an asynchronous action if a handler is attached by either then or catch. Since the handlers are pushed to the Microtask Queue, you can handle the eventual result in a non-blocking way. This makes it easier to handle errors, chain multiple operations together, and keep your code more readable and maintainable!

- [BIG DATA IS DEAD](https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/)

- [Postgres is eating the database world](https://medium.com/@fengruohang/postgres-is-eating-the-database-world-157c204dcfc4)
  > PostgreSQL is emerging as a dominant database platform that is capable of handling a wide range of use cases, from OLTP to OLAP workloads. Its extensibility through a thriving ecosystem of add-ons and integrations allows it to compete with specialized databases across various domains like time-series, geospatial, and vector data. The rise of analytical extensions like ParadeDB and DuckDB have further bolstered PostgreSQL's capabilities, making it a viable alternative to dedicated data warehousing solutions. As hardware advancements have addressed performance and scalability concerns, the need for separate OLTP and OLAP systems is diminishing, leading to a convergence where PostgreSQL can serve as a unified, multi-model database. The author argues that the real competitive frontier now lies in leveraging PostgreSQL's extensibility through integrated distributions and services, rather than focusing on the core database kernel.

- [LiveView is best with Svelte](https://blog.sequin.io/liveview-is-best-with-svelte/)
  > LiveView is a unique approach to building web applications that combines the benefits of server-rendered and client-side frameworks. While LiveView offers many advantages, the authors found some limitations around handling complex client-side interactions and the blurry line between client and server state. To address these challenges, the authors describe using LiveView together with the Svelte frontend framework, which they found to be a powerful and productive combination. The LiveView backend handles data fetching, validation, and state management, while the Svelte frontend focuses on rendering and simple event handling. This "LiveSvelte" approach eliminates the need for a separate frontend microservice and allows for a clean separation of concerns between the client and server.

Gleam is compatible with Elixir, AND it also can compile to js, so you could in theory run the same code on the server and the client. ‚Äî [POiNTx](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39919223)
