> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

## Week 24, 2024

- [Microsoft Will Switch Off Recall by Default After Security Backlash](https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-recall-off-default-security-concerns/)
  > Satya Nadella told the entire Microsoft org that if anyone had to choose between features and security, to choose security. I'm hearing from Microsoft people that all product roadmaps are deferred for a few months while security features are addressed. Their whole corporate spiel is "Microsoft runs on trust" (see the famous standards of business training on youtube).
  >
  > And then someone goes and invents Recall. This is not the work of a lone engineer and a principal PM fishing for Impact or whatever they call success at Microsoft. This had to have gone through multiple levels of review. Microsoft PMs, CVPs, their corpo legal people, marketing approval. And yet no one stopped to say, "wait, this could blow up in our faces"? — https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40615205

## Week 23, 2024

- [Should I Use JWTs For Authentication Tokens?](https://blog.ploetzli.ch/2024/should-i-use-jwt-for-authentication/)
  > They are designed for large-scale environments like Google and Facebook, where the benefits of JWTs (not needing to query a user database for every request) outweigh the drawbacks. However, for most applications that process less than 10,000 requests per second, the complexity of JWTs is unnecessary. A simpler approach is to use a normal opaque session token stored in a database, which is the approach used by most web frameworks.
