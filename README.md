## Week 26, 2025

- [Software Sprawl, The Golden Path, and Scaling Teams With Agency](https://charity.wtf/2018/12/02/software-sprawl-the-golden-path-and-scaling-teams-with-agency/)
  - The Golden Path should be fully supported by the organization, ensuring engineers understand that using non-standard components comes with the responsibility for their maintenance.
  - Emphasizing the need for friction when adding new components can help manage the support burden and prevent unnecessary complexity in the tech stack.

## Week 25, 2025

- [Animating zooming using CSS: transform order is important… sometimes](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/animating-zooming/)
- [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/) - A layman's guide to thinking like the self-aware smol brained
- [How to give a senior leader feedback (without getting fired)](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/how-to-give-a-senior-leader-feedback-without-getting-fired)
  - Before giving feedback, assess your own role in the situation and consider if the issue is worth addressing.
  - Use the "even more" technique to frame feedback positively, suggesting enhancements rather than criticizing past actions.
  - Share personal experiences instead of directly telling the leader what to do to reduce defensiveness.
  - Employ diplomatic language that invites collaboration, such as "What are your thoughts on..." or "Perhaps we could..."
  - Offer concrete examples and data to support your feedback, making it more persuasive and actionable.
  - Position your feedback to focus on future improvements rather than past mistakes to prevent a defensive reaction.
- [Why Generative AI Coding Tools and Agents Do Not Work For Me](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me)
  - reviewing AI-generated code takes as much time as writing code from scratch, if not more.
  - interns learn and improve over time, while AI does not retain knowledge from past tasks.
  - Claims that AI increases speed or productivity often come from lowering quality standards while accepting additional risks, or stem from the interests of AI vendors.
- [If the moon were only 1 pixel: A tediously accurate solar system model (2014)](https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html)
- [How do I give back to people helped me when I was young and had nothing?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44268448)
  - Keep the gates open that were not gatekept for you
  - simply telling them "you were incredibly kind to me and you are a big reason for me trying to be kind to others" might just make their day
  - Pay it forward

> I've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice? Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely. — [aliasxneo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41497113)

> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment. — [CE02](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35056071)
