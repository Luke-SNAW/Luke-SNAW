> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

  - Don’t get too creative. The team settled on an architecture where they could add more of the same nodes to scale.
  - Limit your options.
  - Sharding databases > clustering. It reduced data transfer across nodes, which was a good thing.
  - Have fun! New engineers would contribute code in their first week.
- [How Big is YouTube?](https://ethanzuckerman.com/2023/12/22/how-big-is-youtube/)

  > WebP was more prone to bad posterization and artifacts, especially on photos with smooth gradients.  
  > For similar visual quality on a portrait photo, WebP was actually 30-39% heavier than JPEG.  
  > WebP is not necessarily better than JPEG for all photographic use cases.
