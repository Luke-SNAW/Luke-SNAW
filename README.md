> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

  > The article provides advice on how to improve one's writing through effective editing and revising. It states that first drafts are usually poor but that is normal, as editing is the hidden yet vital second half of writing. By learning to read one's own work as a reader would, an author can better see where the writing fails to effectively convey the intended story. It takes many drafts to transform the ideas in one's head into clear writing that evokes the same experience for others. While the process can feel despairing, persisting through multiple revisions is necessary to craft a story that readers can fully understand and engage with. Effective editing focuses first on major structural issues before minor details.
