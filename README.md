> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

## Week 03, 2024

- [Preventing HTTPS Downgrade Attacks](https://auth0.com/blog/preventing-https-downgrade-attacks/)
  > - configuring servers to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS and setting the HTTP Content-Security-Policy and Strict-Transport-Security headers to enforce HTTPS-only browsing

## Week 02, 2024

- [Use cases of soft delete](https://rahulraj.io/a-better-deletion-approach-than-soft-delete/)
  > - You want to delete records, but also want to retain them for n number of days, just for a safer side against accidental deletion.
  > - You want to exclude some records (permanent retain) under explicit requirements, even if they match the criteria of an eligible record to be deleted.
  > - You don't want to delete the actual resource before returning the resource back. Basically, deletion before returning the value is not desired.
  > - You don't want to modify existing table schema(s) to accommodate soft delete key.
  > - You want the tables as loosely coupled as possible without having to worry about deletion logic.
