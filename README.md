## Week 13, 2023

- [Why Engineers Need To Write](https://www.developing.dev/p/why-engineers-need-to-write)
  > Writing for a child forces me to keep the words and concepts very, very simple, and to write in a style that builds up usage of the program from first principles. Writing for the grumpy old-timer is a practice in minimizing questions from them, forcing me to do a sort of final pass on the overall design of what I'm writing about, to defend design choices, and to add future improvements to the backlog. Drafting the documentation for semi-finished features that are still in progress has sometimes led me to change the design in order to make writing the docs targeting these two people simpler.

## Week 12, 2023

- [Cheating is All You Need](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/cheating-is-all-you-need)

  > Software engineering exists as a discipline because you cannot EVER under any circumstances TRUST CODE.
  >
  > - You get the LLM to draft some code for you that‚Äôs 80% complete/correct.
  > - You tweak the last 20% by hand.

  > > Someone is hesitant about 5 times as productive because we only need to "check the code is good" for [two main reasons](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35275438).
