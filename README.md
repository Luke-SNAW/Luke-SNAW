> I've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice? Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely.

Simplicity, even if it sacrifices some ideal functionality has better survival characteristics than the-right-thing. — [The Rise of Worse is Better](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html)

> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

- [Hundreds of code libraries posted to NPM try to install malware on dev machines](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/11/javascript-developers-targeted-by-hundreds-of-malicious-code-libraries/)
  > The IP address returned by a package Phylum analyzed was: hxxp://193.233.201[.]21:3001.
  > While the method was likely intended to conceal the source of second-stage infections, it ironically had the effect of leaving a trail of previous addresses the attackers had used in the past.

  > Attacks like this one rely on typosquatting, a term for the use of names that closely mimic those of legitimate packages but contain small differences, such as those that might occur if the package was inadvertently misspelled.
