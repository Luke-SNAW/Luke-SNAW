> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

## Week 13, 2024

- [Why choose async/await over threads in Rust?](https://notgull.net/why-not-threads/) explains how async/await allows for more composable and flexible concurrency compared to threads, which can be difficult to synchronize. The author argues that the benefits of async/await, such as its ability to easily add timeouts and other functionality, are not always well-communicated.

  - Probably don’t add `&shy;` to foreign words without a localization expert or at least a native speaker.
  - Probably don’t add `&shy;` to URLs, email addresses, code blocks, and so on.
  - Probably restrict `<wbr>` to URLs, email addresses, code blocks, and similar words where technical accuracy is paramount.
  - Probably restrict `<wbr>` to _before_ periods and dashes and maybe slashes in URLs and emails so it doesn’t look like the sentence or address has ended.
