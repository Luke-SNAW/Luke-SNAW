- [I love building a startup in Rust. I wouldn't pick it again.](https://www.propelauth.com/post/i-love-building-a-startup-in-rust-i-wouldnt-pick-it-again)
  > If you're thinking about building something in Rust, a good question to ask is, "what would I use if Rust didn't exist?" If your answer is something like Go or Node.js, then Rust is probably not the right choice. If your answer is C or C++ or something similar, then Rust is very likely the right choice.
