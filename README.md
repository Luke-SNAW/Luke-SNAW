> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

  > Just because a business workflow involves an entity, such as an “order,” doesn’t mean it has anything in common with other workflows that use that entity. For example, the “pay for an order” workflow and the “delete an order” workflow both involve orders but have completely different business logic. There’s no need for them both to depend on an arbitrary “order” service that lumps a disparate set of functions together.

  > Essentially the ORM can handle about 80-90% of the mapping problems, but that last chunk always needs careful work by somebody who really understands how a relational database works.  
  > ... A framework that allows me to avoid 80% of that is worthwhile even if it is only 80%.
