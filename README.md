## Week 22, 2025

- [The Recurring Cycle of 'Developer Replacement' Hype](https://alonso.network/the-recurring-cycle-of-developer-replacement-hype/)
  > The pattern is becoming clear once again: the technology doesn't replace the skill, it elevates it to a higher level of abstraction.
  > For agency work building disposable marketing sites, this doesn't matter. For systems that need to evolve over years, it's catastrophic.
  - The biggest asset of a developer is saying "no" to people. — [#](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44105883)
- [The Copilot Delusion](https://deplet.ing/the-copilot-delusion/)
  > Management has an AI shaped hammer and they're hitting everything to see if it's a nail. — [#](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44068593)
  >
  > This--all of this--seems exactly antithetical to computing/development/design/"engineering"/architecture/whatever-the-hell people call this profession as I understood it.  
  > Typically, I labored under the delusion that competent technical decision makers would integrate tooling or choose to use a language, "service", platform, whatever, if they saw benefits and if they could make a "case" for why something was the correct approach, i.e how it met some product's needs, addressed some shortcomings, made things more efficient. — [#](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44068694)
  >
  > My point of comparison of choice is overseas contractors, not pair programming.  
  > Copilot or Cursor or whatnot is basically a better experience because you do not have to get on Zoom calls (after Slack has failed) to ask why some chunk of your system that cares about root nodes has mysteriously gained a function called isChild (not hasChildren) that returns a boolean based on whether or not the node has children and not whether it has a parent. Or to figure out why a bunch a API parameters that used to accept arrays now don't. — [#](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44078849)

## Week 21, 2025

- [불만족의 해독제](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMEO5pDwkH0) - 감사함
- [Simple Made Easy - Rich Hickey (2011)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4)
  - Simplicity in software design is about focusing on one task or concept, avoiding the intertwining of multiple functionalities.
  - Choosing simpler constructs and avoiding complex artifacts can lead to more reliable and maintainable software systems.
  - The need for clear separations between "what" a function does and "how" it is implemented is vital for creating effective abstractions in programming.
- [Animated Factorization](http://www.datapointed.net/visualizations/math/factorization/animated-diagrams/)
- [My new hobby: watching AI slowly drive Microsoft employees insane](https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/)
- [The behavior of LLMs in hiring decisions](https://davidrozado.substack.com/p/the-strange-behavior-of-llms-in-hiring): Systemic biases in candidate selection
- ReScript - [Difference vs TypeScript](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/v11.0.0/introduction#difference-vs-typescript)
- [WHAT THE HELL ARE PEOPLE DOING?](https://humans.maxcomperatore.com/) - Live-ish estimates based on global population dynamics & simulated day/night cycles
- [I think the ergonomics of generators is growing on me.](https://macarthur.me/posts/generators/)
  - Generators encapsulate state management, reducing tight coupling between components and allowing for cleaner, more modular code.
    > Since state and logic are self-contained, you could have multiple, distinct generators being used in parallel with no issue.
  - The document illustrates how generators can replace complex patterns like recursion or callbacks, simplifying code and enhancing readability.
- [Mystical](https://github.com/denismm/mystical_ps) - is more like a way to write PostScript that looks like a magical circle.

- 🥱 -> 🤔💡🌱 — [On The Death of Daydreaming](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/on-the-death-of-daydreaming)

> I've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice? Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely. — [aliasxneo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41497113)

> We love to see the process, not just the result. The imperfections in your work can be beautiful if they show your struggle for perfection, not a lack of care. — [ralphammer](https://ralphammer.com/is-perfection-boring/)

> Simplicity, even if it sacrifices some ideal functionality has better survival characteristics than the-right-thing. — [The Rise of Worse is Better](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html)

> [Roberto Blake was talking about making 100 crappy videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnUBaQ1Sp_E) to get better over time. Putting in the reps and improving a little bit each time.
>
> Putting in the work without expecting any external reward at first (eg views, followers, likes, etc) will pay off in the long run. — [100 Scrappy Things](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/100-scrappy-things/)

> Make the difficult habitual, the habitual easy, and the easy beautiful. — [Constantin S. Stanislavski](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7102271-make-the-difficult-habitual-the-habitual-easy-and-the-easy)

> A good match is a **structured** dance, where players aim to **score** while they are following well-defined **rules**. This **freedom within a structure** is what makes it fun. — [ralphammer](https://ralphammer.com/how-to-get-started/)

> “Motivation often comes after starting, not before. Action produces momentum.” — James Clear

> Focus is more about **not** keeping busy when you need to wait for something.  
> Eat the boredom for a minute.

> 도무지 읽히지 않는 책 앞에서 내가 택한 방법은 펼쳐진 페이지 앞에서 멍때리기이다. 다르게 표현하면 이렇다. 펼쳐진 두 페이지 앞에서 오래 머물기.
>
> 책을 펼쳐놓는 것으로 충분하다. 읽지 못해도 좋다. 매일 정해진 진도를 나가야 하는 학교 수업이 아니니까. 하지만 읽지 않아도 괜찮다고 해서 펼쳐두지조차 않으면 곤란하다. 가능한 한 자주 책을 펼쳐두도록 하자. 전혀 읽지 않고 멍하니 바라보고 있다가 다시 덮게 되더라도
> — 막막한 독서. 시로군. P.10~13

> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment. — [CE02](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35056071)

> My real battle is doing good versus doing nothing. — [Deirdre Sullivan](https://www.npr.org/2005/08/08/4785079/always-go-to-the-funeral)
