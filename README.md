> I've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice? Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely.

Simplicity, even if it sacrifices some ideal functionality has better survival characteristics than the-right-thing. — [The Rise of Worse is Better](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html)

> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

## Week 49, 2024

- [You Must Read At Least One Book To Ride](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/you-must-read-at-least-one-book-to-ride/)
- [Go vs Bun, Go언어는 정말 JS 런타임보다 빠를까?](https://tsboard.dev/blog/sirini/41)
  > DB 입출력이 잦은 리얼 월드에서는 **Bun** 런타임과 **Elysia** 웹프레임워크, 그리고 **mysql2** 라이브러리의 조합이 예상 외로 훌륭한 결과를 보여주었습니다. 동시 요청이 많아도 Go가 보여주는 것만큼의 안정적인 동작을 보여주었고, 미약해 보였던 싱글 스레드 기반의 이벤트 루프는 **비동기 I/O와 함께 의외의 슈퍼 파워**를 보여주었습니다.
  - `데이터베이스 드라이버` 병목 의심
  - DB I/O가 많은 리얼 월드 환경에서는 Bun(Elysia 프레임워크와 MySQL2 라이브러리 조합)이 더 안정적이고 효율적
