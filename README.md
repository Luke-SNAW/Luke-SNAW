## Week 37, 2025

- [Your target market isn't demographic](https://longform.asmartbear.com/target-market/)
  - The actual target market is defined by the characteristics shared by users who benefit from a product, not by demographic factors.
  - For a TV show, the target market is not just females aged 19-29, but those who enjoy the genre, actors, aesthetic, and writing style.
- [Local Server Security Best Practices](https://green.sapphi.red/blog/local-server-security-best-practices)
  > 1. An attacker serves a malicious site (e.g., http://malicious.example.com).
  > 2. A user accesses a site that executes JavaScript served by the malicious site. This isn't limited to top-level navigation; it includes embedding via iframes or scripts on external sites.
  > 3. The served JavaScript executes fetch('http://127.0.0.1:3000/main.js'), and the response content is sent to the attacker.
  > 4. The attacker receives the contents of http://127.0.0.1:3000/main.js.
