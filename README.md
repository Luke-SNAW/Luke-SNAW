## Week 30, 2025

- [Why Facts Don’t Change Minds in the Culture Wars—Structure Does](https://vasily.cc/blog/facts-dont-change-minds/)
  - Belief Systems as Structures: Belief systems can be visualized as interconnected graphs where core ideas (nodes) and their connections (edges) form a stable, self-reinforcing structure. Challenging a core idea or connection can destabilize the entire system.
  - Historical Example: The Church's resistance to Galileo's heliocentric model was not just about superstition but about protecting a belief structure that underpinned its authority and societal order.
- [The Big LLM Architecture Comparison](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/the-big-llm-architecture-comparison) - From DeepSeek-V3 to Kimi K2: A Look At Modern LLM Architecture Design
- [Simulating Hand-Drawn Motion with SVG Filters](https://camillovisini.com/coding/simulating-hand-drawn-motion-with-svg-filters)

## Week 29, 2025

- [Rocks, Pebbles, Sand: How to implement in practice](https://longform.asmartbear.com/rocks-pebbles-sand/)
  - Prioritize by impact, not just size: The Rocks, Pebbles, Sand framework emphasizes prioritizing tasks based on their strategic impact rather than just their size or urgency.
  - Use a simple sprint-planning system: Prioritize tasks in this order: time-critical items, Rocks, Pebbles, and Sand. Adjust as needed based on capacity and the readiness of high-quality stories.
  - Avoid common mistakes: Don't let easy or urgent tasks (Sand) crowd out strategic tasks (Rocks). Also, don't assume that the size of a task determines its priority.
- [The sound of inevitability](https://tomrenner.com/posts/llm-inevitabilism/)
  - Debating with a skilled opponent can be challenging, as they can control the conversation's framing, leading to a loss of momentum and confidence.
  - Framing a conversation in your terms is a powerful debating strategy.
  - This framing allows inevitabilists to dismiss opposing views and engage only with those who accept their premise.
- [How I build software quickly](https://evanhahn.com/how-i-build-software-quickly/)
  > - Start with a rough draft/spike
  > - Try to soften requirements if you can
  > - Don’t get distracted

- 🥱 -> 🤔💡🌱 — [On The Death of Daydreaming](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/on-the-death-of-daydreaming)

> I've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice? Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely. — [aliasxneo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41497113)

> We love to see the process, not just the result. The imperfections in your work can be beautiful if they show your struggle for perfection, not a lack of care. — [ralphammer](https://ralphammer.com/is-perfection-boring/)

> Simplicity, even if it sacrifices some ideal functionality has better survival characteristics than the-right-thing. — [The Rise of Worse is Better](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html)

> [Roberto Blake was talking about making 100 crappy videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnUBaQ1Sp_E) to get better over time. Putting in the reps and improving a little bit each time.
>
> Putting in the work without expecting any external reward at first (eg views, followers, likes, etc) will pay off in the long run. — [100 Scrappy Things](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/100-scrappy-things/)

> A good match is a **structured** dance, where players aim to **score** while they are following well-defined **rules**. This **freedom within a structure** is what makes it fun. — [ralphammer](https://ralphammer.com/how-to-get-started/)

- [Pivot Points](https://longform.asmartbear.com/pivot-points/)
  - non-judgmental aspects of personality that can be strengths in some contexts and weaknesses in others
  - Pivot Points are fixed in the short term

> “Motivation often comes after starting, not before. Action produces momentum.” — James Clear

> Focus is more about **not** keeping busy when you need to wait for something.  
> Eat the boredom for a minute.

> 도무지 읽히지 않는 책 앞에서 내가 택한 방법은 펼쳐진 페이지 앞에서 멍때리기이다. 다르게 표현하면 이렇다. 펼쳐진 두 페이지 앞에서 오래 머물기.
>
> 책을 펼쳐놓는 것으로 충분하다. 읽지 못해도 좋다. 매일 정해진 진도를 나가야 하는 학교 수업이 아니니까. 하지만 읽지 않아도 괜찮다고 해서 펼쳐두지조차 않으면 곤란하다. 가능한 한 자주 책을 펼쳐두도록 하자. 전혀 읽지 않고 멍하니 바라보고 있다가 다시 덮게 되더라도
> — 막막한 독서. 시로군. P.10~13

> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment. — [CE02](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35056071)

> My real battle is doing good versus doing nothing. — [Deirdre Sullivan](https://www.npr.org/2005/08/08/4785079/always-go-to-the-funeral)
