## Week 21, 2024

- [New alternatives to innerHTML](https://fullystacked.net/innerhtml-alternatives/)
  - `setHTML`
  - `setHTMLUnsafe` does not perform input sanitization. The setHTMLUnsafe method is particularly useful for working with declarative shadow DOM, where the contents of a `<template>` element with the shadowrootmode attribute need to be rendered as shadow DOM. The setHTML method would remove the template element entirely, whereas setHTMLUnsafe preserves it.
- [A Brief Note on Highlighted Text](https://adrianroselli.com/2024/05/a-brief-note-on-highlighted-text.html)
