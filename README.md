> I've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice? Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely. — [aliasxneo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41497113)

> We love to see the process, not just the result. The imperfections in your work can be beautiful if they show your struggle for perfection, not a lack of care. — [ralphammer](https://ralphammer.com/is-perfection-boring/)

> Simplicity, even if it sacrifices some ideal functionality has better survival characteristics than the-right-thing. — [The Rise of Worse is Better](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html)

> [Roberto Blake was talking about making 100 crappy videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnUBaQ1Sp_E) to get better over time. Putting in the reps and improving a little bit each time.

> Putting in the work without expecting any external reward at first (eg views, followers, likes, etc) will pay off in the long run. — [100 Scrappy Things](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/100-scrappy-things/)

> Make the difficult habitual, the habitual easy, and the easy beautiful. — [Constantin S. Stanislavski](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7102271-make-the-difficult-habitual-the-habitual-easy-and-the-easy)

> A good match is a **structured** dance, where players aim to **score** while they are following well-defined **rules**. This **freedom within a structure** is what makes it fun. — [ralphammer](https://ralphammer.com/how-to-get-started/)

- [Pivot Points](https://longform.asmartbear.com/pivot-points/)
  - non-judgmental aspects of personality that can be strengths in some contexts and weaknesses in others
  - Pivot Points are fixed in the short term

> “Motivation often comes after starting, not before. Action produces momentum.” — James Clear

> Focus is more about **not** keeping busy when you need to wait for something.  
> Eat the boredom for a minute.

> 도무지 읽히지 않는 책 앞에서 내가 택한 방법은 펼쳐진 페이지 앞에서 멍때리기이다. 다르게 표현하면 이렇다. 펼쳐진 두 페이지 앞에서 오래 머물기.
>
> 책을 펼쳐놓는 것으로 충분하다. 읽지 못해도 좋다. 매일 정해진 진도를 나가야 하는 학교 수업이 아니니까. 하지만 읽지 않아도 괜찮다고 해서 펼쳐두지조차 않으면 곤란하다. 가능한 한 자주 책을 펼쳐두도록 하자. 전혀 읽지 않고 멍하니 바라보고 있다가 다시 덮게 되더라도
> — 막막한 독서. 시로군. P.10~13

> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment. — [CE02](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35056071)
