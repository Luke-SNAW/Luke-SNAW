  - use `font-display: optional` to prevent layout shifts
    - hide text for up to 100ms, then only use the web font if it is available - never swapping
    - If font-display: optional is not possible for your design, use f-mods to reduce the impact of font swaps

  - use variable fonts or a limited set of weight variations
