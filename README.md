Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely.

> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

- [Why Not Comments](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/why-not-comments/)
  - The "why not" comments are valuable for documenting negative information - things that the code is not doing.
  - "Why not" comments can serve as signposts for future optimization or changes, even if the current code is working fine.
  - Lengthy function/variable names cannot fully replace "why not" comments, as they cannot capture the tradeoffs and reasoning behind the code.
  - The author suggests that "why not" comments may be a form of "counterfactuals" in human communication, which are difficult to self-document in code.
