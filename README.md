> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

  > Code is a liability, not an asset. Code itself doesn’t bring value: it is the functionality that it provides that brings value. That functionality is an asset if it meets a user need: the code that implements this functionality is simply a means to that end.

  > Production code computes outputs from inputs while tests specify concrete input/output pairs. Complex test logic should be moved to helper functions with their own tests, leaving test bodies simple.

  > `prefetch`를 사용하면 리소스를 미리 캐시 해 두기 때문에 성능이 향상될 것이라고 예상. 하지만 vue-cli3에서 제공하는 prefetch 기능을 사용하면 오히려 첫 렌더링 성능이 저하되는 것으로 확인
