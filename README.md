> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

## Week 27, 2023

- [In Defence of DOMContentLoaded](https://csswizardry.com/2023/07/in-defence-of-domcontentloaded/)
  > The DOMContentLoaded event fires once all of your deferred JavaScript has finished running.
- [The hardest part of building software is not coding, it’s requirements](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/26/the-hardest-part-of-building-software-is-not-coding-its-requirements/) - Why replacing programmers with AI won’t be so easy.

## Week 26, 2023

- [MJML](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml) - the only framework that makes responsive-email easy
- [SSMPL : A Wishful Thinking HTML Replacement Proposal](https://medium.com/codex/ssmpl-a-wishful-thinking-html-replacement-proposal-1e11e8d86bf6)
- [Slonik](https://github.com/gajus/slonik) - A [battle-tested](https://github.com/gajus/slonik#user-content-battle-tested) Node.js PostgreSQL client with strict types, detailed logging and assertions.
- [Stop using Knex.js](https://gajus.medium.com/stop-using-knex-js-and-earn-30-bf410349856c) - Using SQL query builder is an anti-pattern
  > Knex.js (and other query builders) was designed to be a building block for ORMs; it does not add value when majority of the query is static.  
  > I recommend that you use a query builder for those few queries that need to be generated dynamically, and use raw SQL for everything else. It is not one or the other; the two work together.
- [Is ORM still an 'anti pattern'?](https://github.com/getlago/lago/wiki/Is-ORM-still-an-%27anti-pattern%27%3F)

  > - ["ORMs make the easy parts slightly easier, but they make the hard parts really hard"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36500429)

  > - Sequelize is extremely simpler and writing code with it is a joy compared to hibernate.
  > - A year ago i had to develop a big Java application without orm (cto’s choice): i didn’t remember how tedious, error prone and slow is development without orm!!! Never do it again!
  > - I think the best approach is to use orm for common crud tasks and add specific sql queries when things get a little bit complicated.
