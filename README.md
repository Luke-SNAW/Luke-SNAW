> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment.

## Week 41, 2023

- [Thread-per-core](https://without.boats/blog/thread-per-core/)
  > The thread-per-core architecture for Rust async programs has been controversial. While it promises better performance and ease of implementation, it may only achieve one, not both. A share-nothing approach keeps data in separate core caches but is complex to implement transactionally.
  > [The debate isn't about thread-per-core work stealing executors, it's whether async/await is a good abstraction for it in Rust. And the more async code I write the more I feel that it's leaky and hard to program against.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37791635)

## Week 40, 2023

- [Speeding up the JavaScript ecosystem - Polyfills gone rogue](https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem-part-6/)
  > Many popular npm packages depend on 6-8x more packages than they need to. Most of these are unnecessary polyfills.
- [Why HTTP/3 is eating the world](https://blog.apnic.net/2023/09/25/why-http-3-is-eating-the-world/)
  > It uses the QUIC protocol, which improves on TCP by more extensively encrypting metadata and enabling faster connection setup. QUIC also enhances performance by eliminating issues like head-of-line blocking and improving network handling. While HTTP/3 was created to work over QUIC, the true innovation was QUIC itself, which updates TCP with security and efficiency improvements. QUIC encryption makes it easier to update features, since middleboxes cannot access metadata. Overall, QUIC and HTTP/3 enhance web performance and security by modernizing core Internet protocols.
- [Meta in Myanmar](https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup) discusses how hate speech and misinformation spread on Facebook contributed to real-world violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar starting in 2012. Activists had warned Facebook for years about this issue but the company was slow to act.

- [MMO Architecture: Source of truth, Dataflows, I/O bottlenecks and how to solve them](https://prdeving.wordpress.com/2023/09/29/mmo-architecture-source-of-truth-dataflows-i-o-bottlenecks-and-how-to-solve-them/) discusses architecture challenges for massively multiplayer online (MMO) games. Unlike enterprise systems, the source of truth for an MMO's game world is the in-memory state, not the database, as persisting frequent updates would cause bottlenecks. To address this, the article recommends using a data service with the full state cached in memory.
