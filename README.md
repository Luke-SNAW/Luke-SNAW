## Week 8, 2026

- [Don't Trust the Salt: AI Summarization, Multilingual Safety, and Evaluating LLM Guardrails](https://royapakzad.substack.com/p/multilingual-llm-evaluation-to-guardrails)
  - AI summarization tools, while beneficial, should not be solely relied upon by researchers who need to apply critical thinking and subjective understanding.
  - The author developed a method called Bilingual Shadow Reasoning to demonstrate how AI model outputs, particularly in multilingual summarization, can be subtly steered by customized policies (system prompts), potentially bypassing safety guardrails.
  - Customized policies can align LLM outputs with specific political or cultural framings, as shown in an example where Farsi-language policies mirrored the Iranian government's framing of human rights to conceal violations.
- [Use Protocols, Not Services](https://notnotp.com/notes/use-protocols-not-services/)
  - > The Internet is almost anonymous and privacy-preserving by design. I mean, unless some administrator actively tries to track you, there is no built-in identity layer.
  - The debate centers on the trade-offs between open protocols and centralized services, with services often winning due to convenience and rapid feature development, despite potential long-term downsides like enshittification and vendor lock-in. - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47038588
- [Q: I want to wash my car. The car wash is 50 meters away. Should I walk or drive?](https://mastodon.world/@knowmadd/116072773118828295) - What do you think the LLM output was?
- [Introducing Markdown for Agents](https://blog.cloudflare.com/markdown-for-agents/)
  - Converting HTML to markdown reduces token usage by approximately 80%, improving cost and processing efficiency.
  - Supports real-time HTML→Markdown conversion at the network level based on the Accept: text/markdown header.

> I've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice? Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely. — [aliasxneo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41497113)

> A good match is a **structured** dance, where players aim to **score** while they are following well-defined **rules**. This **freedom within a structure** is what makes it fun. — [ralphammer](https://ralphammer.com/how-to-get-started/)

- [Pivot Points](https://longform.asmartbear.com/pivot-points/)
  - non-judgmental aspects of personality that can be strengths in some contexts and weaknesses in others
  - Pivot Points are fixed in the short term

> 도무지 읽히지 않는 책 앞에서 내가 택한 방법은 펼쳐진 페이지 앞에서 멍때리기이다. 다르게 표현하면 이렇다. 펼쳐진 두 페이지 앞에서 오래 머물기.
>
> 책을 펼쳐놓는 것으로 충분하다. 읽지 못해도 좋다. 매일 정해진 진도를 나가야 하는 학교 수업이 아니니까. 하지만 읽지 않아도 괜찮다고 해서 펼쳐두지조차 않으면 곤란하다. 가능한 한 자주 책을 펼쳐두도록 하자. 전혀 읽지 않고 멍하니 바라보고 있다가 다시 덮게 되더라도
> — 막막한 독서. 시로군. P.10~13

> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment. — [CE02](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35056071)
