## Week 5, 2026

- [No more boring drawings!](https://ralphammer.com/no-more-boring-drawings/) - ~~How~~Why to draw something
  > Carefully composed drawings can show **our relation to the world**.
  > It is interesting because we have made a conscious choice of **what is important to us**. And chances are that this is **also interesting for others**.
- [Thief of $90M in seized U.S.-controlled crypto alleged to be government crypto contractor's son](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/single/lick-theft)
- [The future of software engineering is SRE](https://swizec.com/blog/the-future-of-software-engineering-is-sre/)
  > - Everybody wants to write a greenfield demo. Nobody wants to run a service.
  >   - The first 90% to get a working demo is easy. It's the other 190% that matters.
  > - People don't buy software, they hire a service. - result
- [The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)
  - Nonviolent protests are twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts.
  - Civil resistance involving a threshold of 3.5% of the population actively participating has never failed to bring about change.
  - Erica Chenoweth's research analyzed hundreds of campaigns over the last century to compare the success rates of nonviolent versus violent protests.
    > - Chenoweth has backed off her previous conclusions in recent years, observing that nonviolent protest strategies have dramatically declined in effectiveness as governments have adjusted their tactics of repression and messaging. See eg [The Harvard Professor Who Quantified Democracy](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2025/07/erica-chenoweth-democracy-data-harvard) - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46759139
- [Bugs Apple Loves](https://www.bugsappleloves.com/)
  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46727587

## Week 4, 2026

- [AI slop security reports submitted to curl](https://gist.github.com/bagder/07f7581f6e3d78ef37dfbfc81fd1d1cd)
- [The Influentists](https://carette.xyz/posts/influentists/) - The trend of 'hype first and context later' is characterized by individuals called 'The Influentists' who leverage large audiences to propagate unproven or misleading claims.
  > - Doesn't the existence of consumer products like ChatGPT indicate that LLMs aren't able to do human-level work? If OpenAI really had a digital workforce with the capabilities of ~100k programmers/scientists/writers/lawyers/doctors etc, wouldn't the most profitable move be to utilize those "workers" directly, rather that renting out their skills piecemeal? - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46624115
- [Our approach to advertising and expanding access to ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/)
  > - This sounds exactly like what Google used to say about search results. Just a few ads, clearly separated from organic results, never detracting from the core mission of providing the most effective access to all the world’s information. (And certainly not driven by a secret profile of you based on pervasive surveillance of your internet activity.) - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46650756
  > - People are reacting negatively to the ads, but there's a bigger point. This is bearish as heck for AGI. If OpenAI were recursively improving their general-computer-using agent, who was going to be superhuman at every job, they wouldn't need to be messing around with things like this. - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46653567

- 🥱 -> 🤔💡🌱 — [On The Death of Daydreaming](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/on-the-death-of-daydreaming)

> I've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice? Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely. — [aliasxneo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41497113)

> We love to see the process, not just the result. The imperfections in your work can be beautiful if they show your struggle for perfection, not a lack of care. — [ralphammer](https://ralphammer.com/is-perfection-boring/)

> Simplicity, even if it sacrifices some ideal functionality has better survival characteristics than the-right-thing. — [The Rise of Worse is Better](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html)

> [Roberto Blake was talking about making 100 crappy videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnUBaQ1Sp_E) to get better over time. Putting in the reps and improving a little bit each time.
>
> Putting in the work without expecting any external reward at first (eg views, followers, likes, etc) will pay off in the long run. — [100 Scrappy Things](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/100-scrappy-things/)

> Make the difficult habitual, the habitual easy, and the easy beautiful. — [Constantin S. Stanislavski](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7102271-make-the-difficult-habitual-the-habitual-easy-and-the-easy)

> A good match is a **structured** dance, where players aim to **score** while they are following well-defined **rules**. This **freedom within a structure** is what makes it fun. — [ralphammer](https://ralphammer.com/how-to-get-started/)

- [Pivot Points](https://longform.asmartbear.com/pivot-points/)
  - non-judgmental aspects of personality that can be strengths in some contexts and weaknesses in others
  - Pivot Points are fixed in the short term

> “Motivation often comes after starting, not before. Action produces momentum.” — James Clear

> Focus is more about **not** keeping busy when you need to wait for something.  
> Eat the boredom for a minute.

> - [Get running with Couch to 5K](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/running-and-aerobic-exercises/get-running-with-couch-to-5k/)

> [recommended routine - bodyweightfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) - I Don't Have This Much Time!
>
> - Don't workout at all (saves anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes, but really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really not recommended)

> 도무지 읽히지 않는 책 앞에서 내가 택한 방법은 펼쳐진 페이지 앞에서 멍때리기이다. 다르게 표현하면 이렇다. 펼쳐진 두 페이지 앞에서 오래 머물기.
>
> 책을 펼쳐놓는 것으로 충분하다. 읽지 못해도 좋다. 매일 정해진 진도를 나가야 하는 학교 수업이 아니니까. 하지만 읽지 않아도 괜찮다고 해서 펼쳐두지조차 않으면 곤란하다. 가능한 한 자주 책을 펼쳐두도록 하자. 전혀 읽지 않고 멍하니 바라보고 있다가 다시 덮게 되더라도
> — 막막한 독서. 시로군. P.10~13

> I think it should be everyone's primary focus to sleep well, drink water, get outside, get active, and eat generally decently. I hate to say it, but if you're not eating a good amount of vegetables and fruit, decent protein, sleep, etc, no amount of XYZ will catch up to that detriment. — [CE02](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35056071)

> My real battle is doing good versus doing nothing. — [Deirdre Sullivan](https://www.npr.org/2005/08/08/4785079/always-go-to-the-funeral)

[Kind Engineering](https://kind.engineering/) - How To Engineer Kindness
