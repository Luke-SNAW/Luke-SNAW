  - **Browser Events** These events occur in the browser [window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) rather than the HTML page. Event handlers are bound to the window object, not to the element. E.g., load, error, scroll, resize, etc.
  - **HTML Events** This is the inverse of the browser event. They are the event that occurs in the [element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element), and the event handlers are bound to the element. E.g., click, mouseover, mouseenter, etc.
- [5 takeaways from screen reader usability interviews](https://jessbudd.com/blog/screen-reader-usability-testing-observations/)
  - Usually when we think of alt text, we think "What is this a picture of?" - but in the case of links where the only content is an image, the alt text needs to describe the function of that link. Not the image itself.
- [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) - A JSON-like data structure (a CRDT) that can be modified concurrently by different users, and merged again automatically.

Shared types are common data types like `Map` or `Array` with superpowers: changes are automatically distributed to other peers and merged without merge conflicts.
